## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you do find a vulnerability which I very much doubt would happen this early in development then bring it up in issues.
Depending on what time it is we may get back in 30 minutes to 4 hours.
Updating code to make sure it's fixed will take a while but we will get there eventually!
