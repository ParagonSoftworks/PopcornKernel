The Popcorn Kernel is the OS Kernel for the upcoming KudOS Project.


We have put the source code on GitHub so that our community can support us with adding features and fixing bugs via pull requests.


Just head into the "ostest" folder to get started!
You will see a help file explaining what the folders are for.
