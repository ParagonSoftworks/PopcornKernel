# PopcornKernel




The Popcorn Kernel is the OS Kernel for the upcoming KudOS Project.


We have put the source code on GitHub so that our community can support us with adding features and fixing bugs via pull requests.


We also have plans to make the kernel accessible via 32-bit machines too as right now we only support 64-bit. 32-bit support is next on our list. This should come very quickly.


Just head into the "ostest" folder to get started!
You will see a help file explaining what the folders are for.

Supported and Tested Virtualization Software so far: QEMU/QtEmu/UTM (anything that runs on QEMU), VirtualBox and VMware.
Supported and Tested Machines: Toshiba Chromebook 2 using MrChromebox SeaBIOS.

Unsupported Machines: All EFI Mac Machines and All Apple Silicon Machines.

Untested Machines: EFI PCs, Mac Machines that are able to boot BIOS and other machines.

Note: We are never going to support Apple Silicon as that is next to impossible to code for and none of us have a Silicon Machine. If you want an OS that runs on Silicon then just use macOS or even Asahi Linux.
