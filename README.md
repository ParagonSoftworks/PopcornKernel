# PopcornKernel




The Popcorn Kernel is the OS Kernel for the upcoming KudOS Project.


We have put the source code on GitHub so that our community can support us with adding features and fixing bugs via pull requests.

You are currently on the 64-bit branch. This is the first step of making the project 32-bit capable.

Just head into the "ostest" folder to get started!
You will see a help file explaining what the folders are for.

Also make sure to delete the readmes from your own copy when compiling
as this may cause issues.

Supported and Tested Virtualization Software so far: QEMU/QtEmu/UTM (a lot of apps that run on QEMU), VirtualBox and VMware.

We at Paragon Softworks have decided to put out a List of fetures that the Kernel should support.
  
The List includes:

The kernal having a recovery shell.
The kernal having a easy to understand crash screen with readable reasons to why the system crashed.
The kernal using nesting cpu scheduler as a base to make the kernal stable and get the most out of your system.
The kernal being easy to modify and customize for maximum compatability with software and hardware.(vt-d etc.)
