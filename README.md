# PopcornKernel

### Development has been halted until further notice.

AFellowSpeedrunner/MrMasterKeyboard:

The Popcorn Kernel is the OS Kernel for the upcoming KudOS Project.


We have put the source code on GitHub so that our community can support us with adding features and fixing bugs via pull requests.

You are currently on the 32-bit branch. This is the first step of making the project 32-bit capable.

Just head into the "ostest" folder to get started!
You will see a help file explaining what the folders are for.

Also make sure to delete the readmes from your own copy when compiling
as this may cause issues.

LisieDoesCode:

We at Paragon Softworks have decided to put out a list of features that the kernel should support.
  
The list includes:

The kernel having a recovery shell.

The kernel having a easy to understand crash screen with readable reasons to why the system crashed.

The kernel using nesting cpu scheduler as a base to make the kernal stable and get the most out of your system.

The kernel being easy to modify and customize for maximum compatability with software and hardware.(vt-d etc.)
