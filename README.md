# PopcornKernel

### Development has been halted until further notice.

PopcornKernel is the kernel for the upcoming KudOS operating system project. The source code is available on GitHub for community support and contributions through pull requests.

Currently, you are viewing the 64-bit branch of the kernel. This is the first step towards making the project compatible with 32-bit systems. To get started, navigate to the "ostest" folder and refer to the provided help file for more information on the contents of the folder. When compiling the kernel, make sure to delete the readme files to avoid any potential issues.

Paragon Softworks has compiled a list of features that the kernel should support, including:

A recovery shell for addressing system issues.


An easy-to-understand crash screen with clear explanations for system crashes.


A nesting CPU scheduler to ensure system stability and optimize resource utilization.


Customizability for maximum compatibility with both software and hardware (such as VT-d).


We hope these features will make the kernel reliable, easy to modify, and compatible with a wide range of hardware and software.
