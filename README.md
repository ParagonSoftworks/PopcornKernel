# PopcornKernel




The Popcorn Kernel is the OS Kernel for the upcoming KudOS Project.


We have put the source code on GitHub so that our community can support us with adding features and fixing bugs via pull requests.


We also have plans to make the kernel accessible via 32-bit machines too as right now we only support 64-bit. 32-bit support is next on our list. This should come very quickly.


Just head into the "ostest" folder to get started!
You will see a help file explaining what the folders are for.
